# Boolean Algebra
### Laws of Boolean Algebra
| Identity Law | A + 0 = 0 + A = A | A.1 = 1.A = A | 
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------- | 
| Inverse/ Complement Law | A + A' = A' + A = 1 | A.A' = A'.A = 0 | 
| Commutative Law | A + B = B + A | A.B = B.A | 
| Associative Law | A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C | A.(B.C) = (A.B).C | 
| Distributive Law | A.(B + C) = (A.B) + (A.C) | A + (B.C) = (A + B).(A + C) |
